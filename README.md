# BMI Calculator Web Application (Flask)

This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator developed using Python and Flask as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte.  
The application allows users to enter their height and weight and calculates their BMI instantly.



## 📌 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to understand backend development using Python and Flask and to build a basic web application that connects frontend and backend.



## 🚀 Features

- Simple and user-friendly interface  
- Accepts height and weight from the user  
- Calculates BMI using standard formula  
- Displays BMI result dynamically  
- Runs on local server using Flask  



## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask Framework  
- HTML  
- CSS (Basic)  



## ⚙ How the Project Works

The user enters height and weight in the web page.  
The values are sent to the Flask backend using routes.  
Flask processes the data and applies the BMI formula:

BMI = weight / (height * height)

The calculated BMI is returned to the HTML page and displayed to the user.


## ▶ How to Run the Project

1. Install Python  
2. Install Flask using:
   pip install flask  
3. Open terminal in project folder  
4. Run the application using:
   python app.py  
5. Copy the generated local server link  
6. Paste it in the browser to see the output  


## 📷 Output

The application shows input boxes for height and weight and displays the BMI value after clicking the calculate button.
